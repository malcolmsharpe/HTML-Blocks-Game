DrawTile is the bottleneck.

Even in the levels with error areas that receive faces,
the DrawFace calls are not significant.

Lagginess seems to build up when the game is played for some time.
For example, doing a run straight from the beginning and only
skipping Switches (since it is currently bugged), 2-9 (Cave of Wonders)
exhibits much lag. But refreshing and starting with 2-9 is not laggy.

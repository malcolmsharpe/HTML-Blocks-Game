DrawTile is the bottleneck.

Even in the levels with error areas that receive faces,
the DrawFace calls are not significant.

Lagginess seems to build up when the game is played for some time.
For example, doing a run straight from the beginning and only
skipping Switches (since it is currently bugged), 2-9 (Cave of Wonders)
exhibits much lag. But refreshing and starting with 2-9 is not laggy.

~~~

Lag is Chrome-specific. Doing a run from beginning through to 2-9 reliably
produces severe lag in Chrome, but in Safari, doing this same run does not
produce any lag.

Found the cause! To reproduce, repeatedly reset the game. The trouble is that
StartGame calls GameLoop, which then starts a new loop, but the old loop only
terminates itself when the screen changes, which never occurs when reseting
(or when winning a level). This ends up creating many copies of the game loop.

Having fixed this, lag is gone!

Deeper investigation:
- Chrome supports webkitRequestAnimationFrame.
- Safari doesn't, so it falls back to the manual clone.
  The manual clone uses a global variable to attempt to space the frames evenly
  by 16ms. It tries to call the next frame at lastTime+16, and increments
  lastTime by at least 16 each call. This forces the duplicated loops to behave
  like a single loop.

Apparently the nightly builds of Safari support webkitRequestAnimationFrame,
but it hasn't been released yet.
